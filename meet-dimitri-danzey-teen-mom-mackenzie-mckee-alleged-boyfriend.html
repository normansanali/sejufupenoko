According to Mackenzie they are just two friends just making a video together.</p><p>McKee said Dimtri’s feelings for her might be stronger than hers for him. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">She took to <a href=# rel="noopener external">Twitter</a> to explain their relationship. She said “When the guy who likes you posts a 10-second clip on the Tok that went viral and now he’s TikTok famous and everyone thinks your a couple when you are indeed SINGLE! </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#justfriends”</span></p><p>The TikTok which was uploaded TikTok on Dimitri’s account currently has over 1 million views. He had captioned the post “We survived Ian🤠.” While Mackenzie is cleaning some dishes, Dimitri performs a dance for the camera.

In her recent tweet, she suggested that she doesn’t want a relationship.</p><p>Before realizing she needed to forgive herself, the former “Teen Mom” star claimed it took her “losing everything.” She claimed that she felt a weight being lifted off her shoulders once she was able to look at herself in the mirror and acknowledge that she hasn’t always been perfect and has made errors.</p><p>Since she has been in a relationship since she was 13 years old, McKee told her fans, neither a bandage nor other worldly possessions can ease her suffering. She wants to resolve it so she can experience true joy.</p><p>“Everything that has happened for the past five years is starting to make sense,” she said. “God has allowed everything to fold into place so I can be here at rock bottom and find true happiness.

Teen Mom star announced their split after 12 years together. She shared it on her YouTube.</p><p>“Josh and I are divorcing, and we’re in the middle of a divorce, and it is very close to being done and finalized,” she said. This breakup is unlike their previous splits, due to the fact that they have already gone through mediation and decided on the legal terms of their divorce.</p><p>“The divorce is not a yucky, go-to-court type of divorce,” Mackenzie said. “In the end, we aren’t each other’s people, we aren’t meant to be, which is hard to admit because I carried three of his kids.”</p><p>Josh and Mack, according to Mack, agreed on “basically everything” when it came to the divorce, including the fact that she would get the Florida house they bought together back in January. “Now it is just my house,” she said of the four-bedroom home in Palmetto, Florida.</p><p>Josh, according to Mack, intends to return to Oklahoma, the couple’s state of origin. (Josh later relocated there after they made up, although Mackenzie moved there years previously when they were apart.)</p><p>“The kids are going to have parents way back and forth…it’s hard, but I chose to do it so it’s not the same hard,” she said. “I am now a single mom of three kids, pretty much on my own,”</p><p>“We are respecting each other’s dating lives. I have so much love and prayer for whoever Josh ends up with,” Mackenzie said. “My prayer is that they have a relationship that was better than ours, a true love…and he has said the same for me.”</p><p>Now that they have split for good, Mackenzie said that she and Josh get along much better and are able to respectfully co-parent their three kids. “In the end, Josh told me, ‘I’m so proud of you for actually having the courage to leave and do it because nothing was ever going to change. I was never going to change.'”</p><p>“People see me unleashed and finally happy after years of hell [and tell me] ‘I’m worried you are gonna go downhill’ bitch why were you not worried when I was suicidal and being emotionally abused daily,” she tweeted. “I’m good and free. Never been better in fact.”</p><p>The pair started dating in 2009. Mackenzie and Josh became husband and wife in August 2013. They had previously gotten engaged on 4 April 2013. They shared four children; Gannon Dewayne, 10, Jaxie Taylor, 8, and Broncs Weston, 5.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Mackenzie McKee Alleged Boyfriend, Dimitri Danzey?</strong></h3><p>Dimitri Danzey, the alleged boyfriend of Mackenzie McKee is currently 24 years old.
