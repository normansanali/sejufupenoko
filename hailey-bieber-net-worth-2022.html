We’re not saying we’re supermodels. I’d rather people look at us as business people, and, yes, modeling is our business right now, but we’re not trying to take anybody’s spot, and we’re not trying to discredit the past.”</p><p>“Everybody literally thinks I’ve had plastic surgery. My mom’s family calls her, and they’re like, ‘Did Hailey do her lips? Did she do her nose?’ Do people want me to go to a doctor and have them examine my face so they can tell people I haven’t? My face has just matured. I grew into my looks.”</p><p>“My style kind of differs – sometimes I want to be a little dressed down, a little tomboy, sometimes I want to be dressed up and very chic and look proper. But I don’t ever believe in overdoing it for day-to-day style.”</p><p>“All my tattoos except my first were not planned. I would just go into the shop late at night with friends and ask for something on the spot. My first is my parents’ wedding date. I thought it would soften the blow of getting a tattoo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX52uqrjEsmSboZWXsrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZFpaWtnYmd9dn2O</p></div><div id=links><a href=./james-franco-net-worth-2024-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;James Franco Net Worth 2024</a>
