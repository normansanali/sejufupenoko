Who is he? How much is his net worth? Is he married? Who are his parents?</p><p>Learn all about them in this article here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Devon Archer, Hunter Biden Business Associate</strong></h3><p>According to a source close to Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, Hunter’s best friend and business partner, is now “in hiding” after getting “threats.” He is expected to provide Congress with explosive information against the Biden family.</p><p>Devon admitted to friends that he had to leave both his Long Island and Brooklyn homes, but he still intended to go before the House Oversight Committee on Monday. The committee summons Devon to testify in June after learning that he had worked with Hunter on many dubious international transactions.</p><p>Devon is expected to testify about meetings he held with Hunter and Archer’s overseas business associates, where the First Son allegedly had Joe Biden on speakerphone. According to the source, Hunter’s former Devon expressed concern for his and his family’s safety in the days following the announcement of his intended testimony.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“There were reports that he was canceling his appearance. They’re not true, he’s not canceling. But he has gotten threats, and he’s concerned about the threats,’ the source told DailyMail. “His family has received threats. He doesn’t know who from. But you don’t have to be Dick Tracy to figure that out.”</p><p>However, another source close to Devon denied that he was hiding but confirmed that he did receive threats.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Devon was at the center of several shady deals being probed by House Republicans. He was a fellow board member of the allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm Burisma with Hunter and helped Hunter secure a multi-million-dollar real estate deal with the billionaire Moscow mayor’s widow, Elena Baturina.</p><p>The accusation is rejected by Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden’s attorney, George Mesires, reportedly denied ownership of the company Senate Republicans claim was the recipient of the $3.5 million payment in 2014, according to CNN. The assertion that Hunter Biden received $3.5 million is untrue, according to Mesires, because Biden had no involvement with and wasn’t a “co-founder” of Rosemont Seneca Thornton.</p><p>According to a partisan investigation by Senate Republicans, whose report was published this month, Elena Baturina, a Russian businesswoman and the late Yuri Luzhkov’s wife, sent $3.5 million to Rosemont Seneca Thornton in 2014 under the cover of a “consultancy agreement.” There was no additional information regarding the transaction in the report.</p><p>He assisted Hunter in making millions of dollars advising criminals in Romania, China, and other nations through Rosemont Seneca. In 2015, Devon assisted in planning a dinner for their foreign business partners at Cafe Milano in Washington, DC, which was attended by the then-VP Joe, according to emails found on Hunter’s abandoned laptop.</p><p>When Joe was serving as a Vice President, according to the source, he allegedly participated directly in their business meetings abroad.</p><p>Devon Archer was sentenced in NY District Court to 1 year, 1 day in jail plus 1-year parole, and $15 million forfeiture for defrauding a Native American tribe.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Devon Archer Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Devon Archer likely has a net worth above $30 million.</p><p>Devon is best known for co-founding Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment advisory firm that he co-founded with Chris Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, and Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son. The company’s main areas of focus are private equity and advisory services for both domestic and foreign clients. Since Rosemont Seneca Partners has been involved in so many high-profile agreements, collaborations, and partnerships, it has significantly contributed to the growth of Archer’s net worth.</p><p>Devon also helped form Eudora Global, an investment company that specializes in real estate, technology, and renewable energy projects. Eudora Global has made investments in a variety of companies, which has helped Archer achieve overall success in the commercial and financial worlds.</p><p>Devon has established a lucrative career in the real estate and investing industries through these many business endeavors. Even though they have run into legal problems and controversy, these businesses have made a sizable contribution to their net worth over the years.</p><h3><strong>Devon Archer Age</strong></h3><p>As of July 2023, Devon Archer is 49 years old.
