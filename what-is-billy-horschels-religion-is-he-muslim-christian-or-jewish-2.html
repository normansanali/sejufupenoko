The couple met while playing golf at the University of Florida.</p><p>Brittany’s career, however, was cut short due to persistent and nagging wrist injuries.</p><p>In 2010, the pair got married after Billy graduated with a degree in sports management in 2009.</p><p>Billy Horschel and his wife Brittany have three children, all of whom were present to celebrate their father’s victory in the Memorial Championship.</p><p>Brittany gave birth to their eldest daughter, Skylar Lillian Horschel just 48 hours after Billy won the 2014 FedEx Cup, defeating the likes of Jim Furyk and Rory McIlroy.</p><p>Colbie Rae, the second daughter, and Alex Brooks, the son, were born in 2017 and 2019, respectively.</p><p>Horschel opened up about his and wife Brittany’s problems away from the golf course after winning the 2017 AT&T Bryson Nelson title.</p><p>He discussed Brittany’s alcoholism and how it impacted their marriage.</p><p>“You never know what is going on in other people’s lives, and that has certainly been true for me over the last year,” he explained.</p><p>“There are so many families out here who are dealing with a wide range of issues.

The second and third wins of his career came at an ideal time for the six-year PGA Tour veteran.</p><p>He won two events, including the Tour Championship, during the 2014 FedEx Cup playoffs to earn the $10 million bonus awarded to the FedEx Cup champion.</p><p>It brought his total prize money over the last year to $16 million.

After being passed over by several other schools, UF coach Buddy Alexander took a chance on him.</p><p>He successfully qualified for the 2010 PGA Tour through qualifying school in December 2009. A wrist injury limited Horschel to four PGA Tour events that year, and he did not make the cut in any of them.</p><p>In December 2010, he regained his Tour Card through qualifying school to supplement his medical extension in the event that he did not earn enough to secure his Tour Card.</p><p>In February 2011, he made the cut at the Mayakoba Golf Classic, his first PGA Tour appearance in eleven years, finishing T13. Horschel finished the season ranked 140th on the money list, earning him conditional eligibility for 2012.</p><p>Since then, he has won several tournaments, including the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup.
