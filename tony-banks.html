Relationship</span></h2><p>In terms of his personal life, Banks has been married to Margaret McBain since 1972. The couple has two children and lives in London.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Tony_Banks_start_hisher_Professional_Career>How did Tony Banks start his/her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>His career began in 1967. Tony Banks was one of five children born to Nora and John Banks. His musical potential was recognized early on, when he mastered a variety of musical instruments, beginning with classical piano tuition and progressing to self-taught guitar.</p><p>However, as his career with Genesis demonstrated, keyboard instruments were most suited to his style.&nbsp; Genesis, the newly established project, released their first studio album with Decca Records in 1969.</p><p>“From Genesis to Revelation” was the album’s title, and it yielded the single “The Silent Sun” (1968), written by Banks and Peter Gabriel.<br>However, neither the album nor the single was successful, and the band split up and took a brief sabbatical.</p><p>Banks, not giving up on his musical goals, pushed for the ensemble to tour while preparing new material. After being seen by Tony Stratton-Smith at one of their live gigs, the band signed with Charisma Records.</p><p>They published their second studio album for the label, “Trespass,” in 1970, and Banks was extensively featured on this record, both as a songwriter and because the keyboard took center stage in numerous songs, including “The Knife,” which opened with Banks’ solo.</p><p>The album was not well reviewed by critics, who judged it too inconsistent. Nonetheless, the band’s live shows helped them develop popularity and a fanbase.</p><p>With their fourth studio album “Foxtrot” (1972), the band finally found critical and commercial success, with Banks once again credited as a songwriter, in addition to playing Hammond organ, Mellotron, piano, electric piano, 12-string guitar, and providing back-up vocals.</p><p>Along with Mike Rutherford, he was the most consistent band member throughout Genesis’s existence. He collaborated with them on fifteen studio albums, as well as various EPs and live albums.</p><p>Some of his most successful films, both critically and economically, were “Abacab” (1981), “Genesis” (1983), and “We Can’t Dance” (1991), all of which contributed significantly to his net worth.</p><p>Banks attempted to launch a solo career on the side, but it was always overshadowed by Genesis. He recorded five albums but only had moderate success.</p><p>His most successful release was 1983’s “The Fugitive,” which he also produced, and the album was certified gold. Banks also composed film music for films starring Kevin Bacon, such as “The Wicked Lady” (1983) and “Quicksilver” (1986).</p><p>He still tours with Genesis, and he recently recorded the classical album “Six Pieces for Orchestra” (2012).</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/juan-williams-of-fox-news-quits-the-five-43-years-married-life/"}{"1":74}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Will Hackney</a></h3>Will Hackney estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
