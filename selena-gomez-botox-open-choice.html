"It’s normal for skin to show signs of ageing, it’s normal to have scarring and it’s normal for skin to breakout and have texture.

Perhaps acknowledging that our face has wrinkles as a natural consequence of aging, rather than there being something wrong with us or that we’re aging quicker than normal," Lauren continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b136ee34908-selena-walking.jpg><p id=eA-wyKIYYRP6 data-wc=30>"Celebrities being open creates a more honest account of the measures some may go to, to look wrinkle free.

"People look to them for inspiration in different areas, including aesthetic treatments.

"This makes a lot of sense given how we’ve seen women in the limelight criticised for having surgery or beauty procedures.</p><p id=e_EyuRNNnm0z data-wc=47>"This shaming is harmful and is using the woman in question as a red herring, when in reality the problematic situation is the fact that women are oppressed for the way that they look.
