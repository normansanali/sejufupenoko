He plays the role of Vecna, but this is not the only iconic role Bower has played. Bower acted in the Twilight Saga as a Volturi vampire named Caius, first appearing in New Moon and later in Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Breaking Dawn Part 2. The actor also played a young Grindelwald in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and was able to reprise his role in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Campbell Bower's part in the <strong><a href=#>Harry Potter</a></strong> franchise gave him more than just an acting job, though. While on set, Bower became very close with actress Bonnie Wright. The two dated for several years, and there was even an engagement involved before they eventually split. Let’s get into exactly what went down between Jamie Campbell Bower and Bonnie Wright.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Stranger Things Star Jamie Campbell Bower Is So Familiar</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-bonnie-wright><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Bonnie Wright?</span></h2><p>Bonnie Wright is a British actress best known for her role in the Harry Potter franchise. <a href=#>She played Ginny Weasley, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasley family</a>. Wright was only 10 years old when she first appeared in Harry Potter as it was her professional debut as an actress. She appeared in all eight films and fans were able to watch her grow up on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the conclusion of the franchise, Wright has founded her own production company, BonBonLumiere. The company produces short films, including films Wright directs herself.</p><h2 id=bonnie-wright-is-an-activist><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bonnie Wright Is An Activist</span></h2><p>Outside her tremendous acting and producing career, Bonnie Wright has made a name for herself as a spokesperson for environmentalism. In 2017, Wright boarded the ship Arctic Sunrise with Greenpeace to monitor and discuss plastic waste. Following the voyage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wright wrote an article for Greenpeace</a>, saying “Every piece of plastic I have ever used is still somewhere on this earth, and that’s terrifying.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wright is also very outspoken about rainforest preservation and children’s rights and protection. When J. K. Rowling, the writer and creator of Harry Potter, posted a series of tweets targeting the transgender community, Wright was quick to express her support of the community.</p><h2 id=how-jamie-campbell-bower-and-bonnie-wright-met-in-harry-potter><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Jamie Campbell Bower And Bonnie Wright Met In Harry Potter</span></h2><p>As many actor-couples do, Jamie Campbell Bower and Bonnie Wright met on set. Wright had already been a cast member in the Harry Potter franchise since the beginning, she made Bower feel right at home despite his late addition to the cast. Though the couple were never in any scenes together, as Bower’s role was centered around flashbacks, the two quickly hit it off. Their chemistry on set was undeniable to those around them, so it was no surprise to their friends when they began dating in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Bonnie Wright Been Up To Since 'Harry Potter'?</a></span></p><h2 id=when-jamie-campbell-bower-and-bonnie-wright-started-dating><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When Jamie Campbell Bower And Bonnie Wright Started Dating</span></h2><p>Their relationship was obvious to those on the Harry Potter set, but fans of the couple were not given any confirmation until 2010. Jamie Campbell Bower and Bonnie Wright were very private with their relationship, and they had been dating for several months before they decided to go public. At the BAFTAs in February 2010, the Harry Potter couple finally confirmed their relationship for fans. Wright told a reporter, “Yes, we’re dating. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months; it’s good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After going public, Bower and Wright no longer felt the need to hide their relationship, but they still remained relatively private. The couple seemed very happy with each other.</p><h2 id=were-jamie-campbell-bower-and-bonnie-wright-engaged><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Were Jamie Campbell Bower And Bonnie Wright Engaged?</span></h2><p>Just over a year after announcing their joyous relationship to the world, the couple disclosed that they were engaged in 2011! Harry Potter cast mates were stunned by how fast Jamie Campbell Bower and Bonnie Wright were moving, especially considering that Bower and Wright were only 21 and 19 respectively. A source close to the couple revealed to Daily Mail, “All he has told us is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he asked her to marry him</a> and Bonnie said yes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friends were still supportive, however, since they had seen Jamie “on the set just to watch Bonnie and spend time with her between takes.” Bower also stated that “they are completely in love” and that his relationship with Wright was “the real deal.”</p><h2 id=why-jamie-campbell-bower-and-bonnie-wright-split><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Jamie Campbell Bower And Bonnie Wright Split</span></h2><p>Unfortunately for Jamie Campbell Bower and Bonnie Wright, the magic they found on the set of Harry Potter did not last. Apparently, nothing was perfect for the Hollywood couple. Their engagement was called off some time in 2012, ending their 3-year relationship and breaking Harry Potter fans’ hearts. A source revealed to Us Weekly in July 2012 that “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonnie and Jamie split a while ago.</a>”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like their relationship, Bower and Wright kept the details of their breakup private.

It’s sad.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Campbell Bower Totally Lost HImself Playing His Twisted Stranger Things Character</a></span></p><h2 id=who-else-jamie-campbell-bower-dated><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Who Else Jamie Campbell Bower Dated</span></h2><p>Jamie Campbell Bower wasted no time moving on from Bonnie Wright.
