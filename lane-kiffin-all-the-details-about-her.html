For years, the couple enjoyed a beautiful marriage until they decided to part ways amicably. Between them, the ex-flames have three kids.</strong></p><p>In addition, Layla comes from a sporting family. Her father was an American football quarterback who was a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and other prestigious teams.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Layla_Kiffin_the_spouse_of_Lane_Kiffin_Her_Lineage_Backward>Who is Layla Kiffin, the spouse of Lane Kiffin? Her Lineage Backward</span></h2><p>Layla worked as an event coordinator throughout college. After marrying Lane Kiffin, she left the position to devote all of her time to her family.</p><p>Regarding her family history, Kiffin is the daughter of John Reaves, a former Florida quarterback who was an All-American. He participated in 11 NFL seasons, making significant contributions to several teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>In addition, John worked as a coach for many years before to entering the real estate market. Regretfully, on August 1, 2017, Reaves died at the age of 67.</p><p>There is no information known regarding Layla’s mother. Layla once claimed to Knox News that her mother wasn’t a good chef when the reporter inquired about a family favorite dish.</p><p>“Although my mother is an amazing person, she is not a chef. She was known to us as Microwave Patti. I’m sorry, but I don’t have any family recipes to share.</p><h2><span id=Is_There_A_Sibling_for_Layla_Kiffin>Is There A Sibling for Layla Kiffin?</span></h2><p>David Reaves and Stephen Reaves are Layla’s two brothers. The brothers Reaves participate in sports as well. In the past, David assisted Lane as a coach at the University of Tennessee.</p><p>However, Stephen is also a former football player who was a quarterback for the Toronto Argonauts.</p><h2><span id=Is_She_From_Anywhere_earned_a_degree_from_Florida_University>Is She From Anywhere? earned a degree from Florida University</span></h2><p>Layla, the ex-wife of Lane, was born in Tampa, Florida, on January 4, 1975. Her family raised her in Tampa. She attended Bucholz High School in Gainesville, Florida, for her education.</p><p>Layla enrolled at the University of Florida in 1992 and graduated in 1996.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Layla_get_to_know_Lane_Kiffin_her_husband>How did Layla get to know Lane Kiffin, her husband?</span></h2><p>The pair was initially introduced by Lane’s father, Tampa Bay Buccaneers coordinator Monte Kiffin. In 1999, while Lane was visiting his father, his future wife Layla was working as an event director for the Buccaneers. That was how their first encounter occurred.</p><p>They fell in love right away.</p><p>Prior to their marriage, they were dating for a year.</p><p>Only three months before the relationship, Lane asked his then-girlfriend Layla to marry him. According to reports, he requested his father-in-law John’s approval before posing the big question.</p><p>Lala’s father John explained,</p><p>“Lane came to visit me, the receptionist at my office buzzed me. I assumed he was going to say he was looking for a job and was leaving coaching. Rather, he inquired about becoming married to my daughter. I asked her over the phone, “Is he serious?” I wasn’t meant to spoil the surprise, I chuckle. That day, they purchased an engagement ring.</p><p>In July 2000, the two said their vows together.</p><h2><span id=How_Many_Kids_Do_The_Former_Couple_Have_Together>How Many Kids Do The Former Couple Have Together?</span></h2><p>They have three kids together. In 2005, Layla and her spouse Lane welcomed Landry, a girl, as their first child. Early in 2007, she gave birth to Presley, their second daughter. Knox, their first boy and third child, was born in 2005 as well.</p><p>In an interview with Knox News, Layla stated that she never considered giving up her job to care for her kids and keep the family routine together. She insisted,</p><p>“I was really content with the direction my career was taking and I loved what I did now that they’re here, I can’t even consider going to work. I just can’t get into it. We’ve expressed a desire for additional children, but I’m not sure. Right now, I’m content with what I have.</p><p>Preparing meals for her family is her most cherished domestic task. Her children like spaghetti.</p><p>Regretfully, Layle and her spouse parted ways in 2016.</p><p>After several years of marriage, Lane and his wife Layla parted ways in 2016. The football coach informed Bruce Feldman of FOX Sports that they had split amicably.</p><p>Layla and I have jointly chosen to get a divorce after giving it a lot of contemplation. We firmly believe that our children’s future should come first. While raising these three amazing children, we will continue to have a cordial and respectful relationship. We respect the privacy of our family and will not be commenting more.</p><p>The news that Layla filed for divorce on March 4, 2016, was initially revealed by TMZ. She requested spousal maintenance in addition to shared legal custody of their children.</p><p>Lane later disclosed that he gave his ex-wife 34.5% of his total income. Says he,</p><p>“I honestly don’t have any income. I pay taxes at a rate of about 52%. In the divorce, Layla receives 34.5 percent, while [agent Jimmy Sexton] receives 3 percent. My income is [about] 9%, and I reside in Tuscaloosa.</p><p>Although they never gave an explanation, there were allegations that the pair broke up in 2015 when the alleged affair with Kristen Saban became public. However, it was eventually shown to be a scam.</p><h2><span id=In_2020_what_is_Layla8217s_current_romantic_status>In 2020, what is Layla’s current romantic status?</span></h2><p>In 2020, the ex-celebrity husband is not formally dating anybody.
