It's considered one of the hottest places in the world, with an average daily temperature of about 94 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as one of the lowest (the depression is over 400 feet below sea level).</p><p>Temperatures in the area can rise up to 120 or even 130 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes it a deeply inhospitable — if visually striking — region.</p><p>The depression itself was once part of the Red Sea. It formed slowly over time as volcanic eruptions cut off a section of the water, which then evaporated in the arid climate. Today, the Danakil Depression covers an impressive swath of land, 124 miles by 31 miles, in the north of Ethiopia.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-480412 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/danakil-depression.jpeg alt="Dallol Ethiopia" width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-480412 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>A.Savin/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The vibrantly colored hot springs of the Danakil Depression.</span></p><p>The boiling hot springs and sulfur fields of Dallol are among the area's main draws. This may prompt the question: Why would anyone want to travel to one of the hottest places on Earth?</p><p>Though Dallol is certainly hot, it's long attracted travelers curious to see its startling array of colors. Here, visitors can enjoy a landscape that pops in bright greens, sultry reds, and lemony yellows.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> reported in 2017 that these colors are formed by the region's unique geology. Magma from nearby volcanoes heats the groundwater, which bubbles to the surface and dissolves salt and other minerals as it boils in hot springs. The crust that remains takes on the vibrant colors of minerals, iron, and salty algae, creating a landscape that looks like something out of science fiction.</p><p>And though conditions in Dallol are difficult to endure, the region has long drawn local people seeking to harvest its abundance of salt, or "white gold."</p><h2>Life In The Danakil Depression</h2><p>Though it's been called the "gateway to hell" and the "land of death," the Danakil Depression has been home to the Afar people for centuries. A nomadic people who move around the region with herds of goats, camels, and cattle, the Afar have long harvested salt from the depression to sell.</p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel=noopener>CNBC</a> reported in 2020 that salt, or "white gold," was used as a form of currency in Ethiopia up until the 20th century.</p><p>Miners often have to travel for hours or even days to reach the salt fields. Once there, they mine the salt by hand. <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a> wrote in 2014 that the salt is cut into 6.5-pound slabs, then loaded onto camels. The camels are then led in groups of 10 to 15 by two Afar herders, who guide them during their long walk out of the desert.</p><p>Despite the considerable obstacles that face salt miners, the region has also drawn interest from outsiders. In the 20th century, European, Indian, and American investors all tried to establish a foothold in the region to profit from its landscape. However, most of these mines have since been abandoned.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-480416 alt="Danakil Depression" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/camels-transporting-salt.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-480416 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ILRI/Fiona Flintan/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>Camels transporting salt in the Danakil Depression. Salt has long been considered "white gold" in the region, and was even used as a form of currency in Ethiopia up until the 20th century.</span></p><p>That said, the Danakil Depression and Dallol itself continue to draw curious travelers from across the world. Though <a href=# rel=noopener>it can be dangerous</a> —&nbsp;there are border skirmishes between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and European tourists were kidnapped and killed in 2012 — people continue to flock to the region to gaze upon the incredible colors of Dallol.</p><p>CNBC reports that people usually depart from the nearby town of Wikro around 4 a.m., and drive three hours to reach the stunning sights of the Danakil Depression.</p><p>"The Danakil Depression really is one of the most incredible natural wonders in the world," Henok Tsegaye, a local tour guide, told CNBC. "It is one of the most alien places on Earth, and with Ethiopia growing in popularity as a destination, we are seeing more and more travelers."</p><p>And it's not only tourists who want to see Dallol and the Danakil Depression. The region has also drawn scientists in recent years, who are hoping to apply lessons from the inhospitable region to better understand how life functions on other planets.</p><h2>From Dallol To Mars: What The Region Can Teach Us About Different Kinds Of Life</h2><p>In 2016, The New York Times reported that researchers from Spain's Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid, Italy's University of Bologna and the International Research School of Planetary Sciences, and Ethiopia's University of Mekelle descended on Dallol to study extremophiles, microbes that are able to live in extreme conditions.</p><p>These microorganisms are able to survive in areas where humans can not, like hot springs, hydrothermal vents, salty lakes, and polar ice caps. Scientists are hoping to learn more about them, because their existence suggests that life can be possible on other planets. Specifically, planets like Mars.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-480423 alt="Scientists Collecting Samples" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scientists-collecting-samples-1.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-480423 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Barbara Cavalazzi</span><span class=caption-body>Scientists collecting samples from Dallol in hopes of learning more about extremophiles.</span></p><p>Felipe Gómez, who led the expedition to better understand the Danakil Depression's extremophiles, told The New York Times that the goal was "to try to know the limits of life and the possibility of such forms of life in other planets like Mars."</p><p>Studying these unusual forms of life, he further explained, is "a way to train ourselves to identify different forms of life for astrobiological exploration."</p><p>Another team of researchers, however, had bad news for anyone hoping to find life on Mars. Their study of Dallol in 2019 suggested that life could not survive under the area's most extreme conditions — namely its hot, salty, and acidic hydrothermal pools. In these places, <a href=# rel=noopener>Live Science</a> reported in 2019 that researchers found no DNA "and thus no trace of a living organism."</p><p>That said, another research team who examined the pools around the same time believe that they did find traces of life. But their findings may be "weak" because of possible contamination from nearby salt plains.</p><p>All said, it seems that Dallol will continue to draw both scientists and travelers, all of whom hope to experience the region's unique characteristics. If you're not quite ready to book your trip to Ethiopia, enjoy the gallery of colorful photos from Dallol instead.</p><p>Some day, pictures will be all that's left of the region. In millions of years, scientists suspect that it will get swallowed once more by the sea.</p><p>Want to learn about more extreme places after looking at Dallol, the hottest place on Earth?
