Jessica After Chelsea Split</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><a href=#>Love Is Blind’s </a><strong>Jimmy Presnell</strong> revealed whether or not he’d consider dating <strong>Jessica Vestal</strong> after his split from ex-fiancée <strong>Chelsea Blackwell</strong>.</p><p>“Out of respect for Chelsea, I don’t plan to go down that road,” Jimmy, 28, exclusively told Us Weekly while discussing season 6 of the Netflix show. “And we’ve spoken a little bit, but not in a relationship type of way.”</p><p>Although Jimmy said he has “<a href=#>no regrets</a>” over his decision to propose to Chelsea, 31, he did note that there is a sense of wondering “what or how things could have been” if he had chosen Jessica, 31, instead. The pair formed an instant connection in the pods but had a heated breakup when Jimmy ultimately decided Chelsea was The One.</p><p>The duo came face to face for the first time in episode 11 during a <a href=#>cast lake party</a>. While chatting about their split during a private one-on-one, Jimmy told Jessica that she was his first choice until the final day in the pods — a confession he believes got&nbsp;blown out of proportion.</p><p>“I will say the way she was looking at me and the way she was talking to me, it definitely brought back some old feelings, but I was only level setting with her, letting her know that the day before proposal day, she was my No. 1 going into that day,” he explained to Us. “But [that’s] because she made it this whole deal that I didn’t love her and I didn’t want things to work, and I already had a decision made.”</p><p>Jessica, for her part, told Us that she didn’t “think much” of Jimmy’s comment either, noting that he <a href=#>acted appropriately</a> when for someone who had a fiancée at the time. (Jimmy and Chelsea ultimately called it quits before the altar during the season 6 finale.)</p><p>“I’m not sure the context that that was said in, but I will say he did conduct himself well and respectfully [at] the lake party,” she said. “He made it known that he felt like he made the right decision and he was excited to be <a href=#>marrying Chelsea</a>. I didn’t get the thought that he was wishing it had been me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Love-Is-Blind-s-Jimmy-Presnell-Says-He-Doesn-t-Plan-to-Date-Jessica-Vestel-Out-of-Respect-to-Ex-Chelsea-Blackwell-428.jpg><p>Jimmy and Jessica’s relationship issues began in the final days in the pods when Jessica gifted Jimmy a letter she once wrote herself about her hopes for a future husband. When his reaction was underwhelming, Jessica stormed out on their date within the first 10 minutes. It was that interaction — plus a 3-hour date with Chelsea the same day — that ultimately led Jimmy to his final choice.</p><p>“Because [Jess] walked out on me, the way she handled conflict was not for me,” he told Us. “I got a glimpse of what I might have in the future. And I personally don’t care if she’s the hottest girl in the world. If someone’s going to talk down to me and be disrespectful to me, I’m going to.”</p><p>While arguing in the pods, Jessica had warned Jimmy that he would need “an EpiPen” when he first saw her in person, a comment that quickly went viral after it aired. Jimmy, however, told Us that no medical assistance was needed during their interaction, stressing that not everything should be about “looks.”</p><p>Jessica, meanwhile, explained her reasoning for the dig, which she claims<a href=#> was unplanned</a> and stemmed from feeling hurt over their split.</p><p>“He told me that he had to keep an EpiPen on him at all times because he had such severe allergies [that] his airways would close if he didn’t have it,” she said via her Instagram Story last month. “So, it had been top of mind for a couple days. … When I was giving my breakup speech, which wasn’t planned or rehearsed, I was just heartbroken and I blacked out and the EpiPen line just fell out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued, “So, it had been top of mind for a couple days. I was thinking, ‘Jeez, if I’m going to date this man, I’m gonna have to learn how to use this EpiPen on him so he doesn’t choke.’ And so, when I was giving my breakup speech, which wasn’t planned or rehearsed, I was just heartbroken and I blacked out and the EpiPen line just fell out.”</p><p>New episodes of Love Is Blind season 6 air Wednesdays on Netflix.</p><p>Reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUqHqrtcymsGacn5rAr8CMqaOapl2pvG6wwK2cZqKVqMCqr8BmmJ%2Bslad6pLTEpaqemV2ova2102g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meet-van-jefferson-father-shawn-and-mother-marla-jefferson-where-is-he-from-details-to-know-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meet Van Jefferson Father Shawn And Mother Marla Jefferson, Where Is He From?
