Is he married? Who are his parents? What job does he have?</p><p>Read all about him in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Brad Fiorenza On The Challenge Season 39</strong></h3><p>The Challenge has returned for season 39 and Brad Fiorenza is one of the 24 contenders this season.</p><p>He is the Cutthroat champion and has appeared on The Duel, The Gauntlet III, The Duel II, and All Stars 3. He also appeared in Battle of the Sexes 2, The Inferno II, The Gauntlet 2, The Ruins, Vendettas, Final Reckoning, and All Stars 2 as a competitor.</p><p>In total, he has won $75,000.</p><h3><strong>Is Brad Fiorenza Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Brad Fiorenza is a single dad now. But, he was previously married to his ex-wife Tori Hall. Although they found love in The Challenge, it couldn‚Äôt last forever.</p><p>Tori and Brad, who married in 2010 two years after meeting on MTV‚Äôs The Gauntlet III, separated in 2015 and divorced in December 2016. In an exclusive reply to Us Weekly, the former Miss Teen USA, who has not been on reality television since 2010, responded to her ex‚Äôs charges.</p><p>Their relationship drama went public when Brad accused his ex-wife Tori of turning their sons against him. ‚ÄúKids are not possessions, they are people. If you teach your kids to dislike one parent, even if you were raised that way, it‚Äôs like telling them they are half bad. In my opinion that is child abuse & not negotiable,‚Äù he tweeted on Wednesday, April 17, 2019.</p><p>Brad sent many further texts between then and Friday, April 19, but never mentioned Tori by name. When one of his fans informed him that he has rights as a father, ‚ÄúIt costs a lot of money to keep enforcing them. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anybody. I still count my blessings every day but talk about pain.‚Äù</p><p>Brad also claimed that he tried to discuss the situation with Tori privately but ‚Äúit only got my kids moved out of state,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI sat on a pile of receipts from another man‚Äôs wife for 2 years.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhen I hear of Brad saying something or tweeting irrational, I try to go to the mindset that he is hurting, and hurt people hurt people,‚Äù Tori shared. ‚ÄúI will always encourage the boys to have a relationship with their dad. Always. To say otherwise is simply untrue. I‚Äôm not operating in a place of hurt or anger, so my stance on this isn‚Äôt as emotionally driven as others. I took time to heal and deal with the divorce, and it‚Äôs made all the difference. Three years ago my response to this would have been very different.‚Äù</p><p>Tori also denied any claims of cheating. ‚ÄúAs far as me having an affair or breaking up another family, there is no truth to that. None,‚Äù the Road Rules&nbsp;vet told&nbsp;Us. ‚ÄúI know people would love for this to be the case so that they could pinpoint the reasoning/fault of our divorce, but it‚Äôs just not true.‚Äù</p><p>His son Brady turned 12 years old in August 2023. Back in 2017, Brad wished his son, ‚ÄúHAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! to the cutest 6-year-old, I know!! This boy changed my life forever 6 years ago today.
