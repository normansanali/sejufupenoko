style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The <strong><a href=#>Harvey Weinstein</a></strong> scandal has been a very high-profile case that has had the public on the edge of their seats for a long time, but it seems to finally be dying down. For those who don't know or don't remember, in 2017, Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was accused by several women in the industry, such as <strong><a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Rose McGowan</a></strong>, Asia Argento, and many more, of assault. At the beginning of last year, he was finally sentenced to 23 years of prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What Harvey Weinstein's Daughters Are Doing Now</a></span></p><p>After such a traumatic event, Asia became one of the most vocal leaders of the <a href=#>Me Too movement</a>, but she hasn't let it define her life. She has moved on with her life, both personally and professionally, and these are a few of the many amazing things she has done since the scandal.</p><h2 id=she-wrote-a-book><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Wrote A Book</span></h2><p>This year, Asia decided to finally publish a project she had had in the works for a long time. She released her autobiography,&nbsp;Anatomia di un Cuore Selvaggio, or&nbsp;Anatomy of a Wild Heart, and although it's currently only available in Italy, hopefully everyone will be able to get it soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had been telling myself for many years that I should do it, and in fact I did. I wrote my autobiography which will be released on January 26th," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said about it</a>. "It takes courage to prescribe yourself a complete auto-autopsy, I don't know how many would be satisfied with the outcome of the ruthless analysis of themselves. So take courage, this is mine and, before judging, I invite you to do the same."</p><h2 id=she-wrote-and-directed-a-short-movie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Wrote And Directed A Short Movie</span></h2><p>Fashion has always been very important for Asia, so when she had the opportunity of writing and directing a short film about fashion for Antonio Grimaldi, a Rome-based designer, she accepted in a heartbeat. The short movie is called&nbsp;Ælektra, and it came out last year. Her beautiful daughter, actress Anna Lou Castoldi, starred in it with her, so it was a special project in many different ways. People can find it in her Youtube channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-collaborated-with-the-penelopes><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Collaborated With 'The Penelopes'</span></h2><p>At the beginning of last year, Asia Argento collaborated with the French indie duo The Penelopes. They did a cover by a band the three of them love, Suicide, and Asia was beyond excited to be a part of the project.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow/Brad Pitt & 9 Other Celeb Couples Who Almost Got Married</a></span></p><p>"The new song I did with @thepenelopes - a cover of one of my favorite bands ever #Suicide, DREAM BABY DREAM is out now on YouTube and all the digital platforms," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared on an Instagram post</a>.</p><h2 id=she-said-goodbye-to-an-old-friend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Said Goodbye To An Old Friend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Losing friends and mentors is never easy, but in this case, there is the relief that Asia's good friend, French actor and director Michel Piccoli, lived a long and happy life. Not only that, but he managed to have an extensive and colorful career that spanned for many decades. He passed away last year, at the age of 94, and Asia wrote a heartfelt tribute to him on her Instagram account. She thanked him for everything he taught her, for their time together, and for being so loving and kind when she was starting her career.</p><h2 id=she-created-a-jewelry-line><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Created A Jewelry Line</span></h2><p>Last year, Asia decided to dabble in a new form of art, which is jewelry design. Through a friend of hers, jeweler Jonathan Johnson, she designed her own <a href=#>jewelry collection</a>, which she named 7 Deadly Sins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<span title=Editado>In a collaboration with artist @jonathanjohnsonjewelry, I have created a collection inspired by the 7 deadly sins," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared</a>. "The concept of Sin is deeply human, and it has accompanied our culture since its very creation. But bear in mind, the true sinner is not the whore, nor the drunkard, nor the homeless person, nor the drug addict. It is not the thieves who steal out of despair, nor the refugees who have to work illegally in the fields. The real sin is the destruction of the environment out of greed for profit, the resurgent populism, exploitative production in low-wage countries, corporations without scruples, and the creation of artificial borders between people."</span></p><h2 id=she-starred-in-the-movie-agony><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Starred In The Movie 'Agony'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although&nbsp;it had been filmed a few years before, it was in 2020 that the movie&nbsp;Agony, originally titled&nbsp;The Executrix, came out. Asia was one of the stars, and the thiller was directed by Italian director&nbsp;Michele Civetta. The movie followed the life of a woman from New York who was bored of her ordinary life. It all changes when she receives a call from Tuscany, saying that she needs to travel to sort out her estranged mother's will. The whole experience forces her to confront the demons from her childhood she thought she had managed to leave behind.</p><h2 id=she-got-new-tattoos><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Got New Tattoos</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As any Asia Argento fan knows, she is very much into tattoos. A few months ago, she decided to add some more to her collection, and for that she went to <a href=#>one of the best tattoo artists</a> in Italy, Marco Manzo.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Remember Sarah Rose Karr From Beethoven? Here's What She's Up To Now</a></span></p><p>She was very pleased with the results, and with the help of one of her photographer friends, she took a couple of incredibly artistic pictures to show her followers her new designs. In her Instagram post, she thanked Marco for "turning her into a living work of art."</p><h2 id=she-s-promoting-her-friend-s-business><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She's Promoting Her Friend's Business</span></h2><p>One of Asia's favorite <a href=#>record label</a> is her friend and collaborator Mathias Modica' label, Toy Tonics, and she wants the whole world to know how important it is for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can’t even count how many of their vinyls I own, and they have brought so much joy in my life since 2013," she said about it.</p><p>She also referred to the song she had done with Mathias years ago, Live Fast! Die Old!, and encouraged people to listen to it and check out Toy Tonics' merch.</p><h2 id=she-went-on-a-vacation-with-her-children><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Went On A Vacation With Her Children</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Asia is very close to her children. She constantly posts pictures with her son Nico, and <a href=#>she has worked closely with her daughter</a> Anna Lou, who is also an actress. Not too long ago, the three of them took a trip together to the Maldives, and they stayed in a beautiful, luxury villa in the water. She posted a few pictures during their stay there, of the three of them having fun together and of the many amazing things they could see and do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-practiced-shooting><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Practiced Shooting</span></h2><p>During a trip she took to Switzerland, Asia decided she wanted to hone a particular skill: shooting. As long as you do it in a safe environment, it's something that is very handy to learn. It is unclear whether she had done it before or not, but she seemed very confident in the videos and pictures she posted. She tried two different guns, and she jokingly said on the caption that it was a "normal day at the office."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>2000s One Hit Wonders: What Are They Up To Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJqrmZZ6or7GnqWtp12drrR5wZ6cp2WlpXq0tc2cnGasmJp6qa3Rr5yyZaeatq%2B%2F056gp2WjmK6vsMClZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./real-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html>&#171;&nbsp;Real Housewives of Orange County Jennifer Pedranti Moved on From Her Husband With Ryan Boyajian</a>
