This may not always be the case, however; sometimes the entities are still considered separate Pokémon in their own right, and in some cases, will occasionally disconnect and return to being two separate living creatures.</p><h2><span id=List_of_multiple_entity_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=List_of_multiple_entity_Pokémon>List of multiple entity Pokémon</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Paras_and_Parasect>Paras and Parasect</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/ee/Paras_Mushroom.png/300px-Paras_Mushroom.png decoding=async width=200 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Paras removing its tochukaso <a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1e/Parasect_Sleep_Powder_EP241.png/300px-Parasect_Sleep_Powder_EP241.png decoding=async width=200 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# title="Paras (Pokémon)">Paras</a> are <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="List of Pokémon by body style">insectoid</a> creatures that have parasitic <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Ophiocordyceps sinensis">tochukasu</a> mushrooms growing on their backs. Their relationship is somewhat symbiotic—the mushroom leeches most of the nutrients obtained, while the Paras uses its spores for attacking. While the mushrooms can be removed, scientists believe doing so is bad for the Paras's health.</p><p>After Paras evolves into <a href=# title="Parasect (Pokémon)">Parasect</a>, the mushrooms are larger than the host. The fungus completely controls the Pokémon and does all the thinking. In fact, Parasect frequent dark, damp places only because of the parasite's preference.<br clear=all></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Dugtrio>Dugtrio</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/c/c7/Katie_Dugtrio.png/450px-Katie_Dugtrio.png decoding=async width=300 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> A Dugtrio is comprised of three Diglett huddled together<p>When three <a href=# title="Diglett (Pokémon)">Diglett</a> gather in one place, the Pokémon will evolve into a <a href=# title="Dugtrio (Pokémon)">Dugtrio</a>. It will not undergo a very drastic change in evolution, though each Diglett which makes up the Pokémon will be noticeably larger, and will generally be wearing a frowning expression. The three Diglett triplets think in exactly the same way, and work together to <a href=# title="Dig (move)">dig</a> large tunnels and trigger <a href=# title="Earthquake (move)">earthquakes</a>.</p><p>As no-one has ever seen the lower half of a Dugtrio's body, which is concealed under the ground, it is unclear whether the three Diglett triplets are fused together or if they are still separate bodies. Some Pokédex entries state that Dugtrio are triplets that emerged from a single body, implying that the fusion of three Diglett is not always necessary for the creation of a Dugtrio (as is the case in the games).<br clear=all></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Slowbro_and_Slowking>Slowbro and Slowking</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b7/Slowbro_anime.png/450px-Slowbro_anime.png decoding=async width=300 height=169 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> After waiting patiently with its tail dipped in the water, a Shellder will eventually latch onto the Pokémon's tail and trigger evolution<p><a href=# title="Slowpoke (Pokémon)">Slowpoke</a> emit a sweet-tasting substance from their tails, which acts as a lure for <a href=# title="Shellder (Pokémon)">Shellder</a>. When a Shellder bites onto a Slowpoke's tail, the two Pokémon undergo a major transformation, evolving into a <a href=# title="Slowbro (Pokémon)">Slowbro</a>. Slowpoke will begin to walk upright, and the Shellder will become a spiral-shaped shell instead of a bivalve, with noticeably different facial features. The Shellder will latch onto Slowbro's tail, following it wherever it goes. However, occasionally it is possible for a Shellder to let go of the tail, in which case Slowbro will revert to its original Slowpoke state.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e2/Slowking_M02.png/263px-Slowking_M02.png decoding=async width=175 height=98 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>On rare occasions, after being attracted by a <a href=# title="King's Rock">King's Rock</a>, a Shellder will bite into a Slowpoke's head instead of its tail. When this happens, Slowpoke will instead evolve into a <a href=# title="Slowking (Pokémon)">Slowking</a>. Poison from Shellder's teeth seeps into Slowking's head, unlocking an extraordinary power and intellect. Thus, Slowking are a lot more intelligent than Slowpoke and can use their Psychic abilities to full potential. It is also capable of learning to <a href=# title="Talking Pokémon">speak like a human</a>, an ability which only a select few Pokémon have mastered.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Magneton_and_Magnezone>Magneton and Magnezone</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ac/Wattson_Magneton.png/450px-Wattson_Magneton.png decoding=async width=300 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Magneton is comprised of three Magnemite, linked by strong magnetism<p><a href=# title="Magneton (Pokémon)">Magneton</a> is the result of three <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Magnemite>Magnemite</a> linking together. The three Magnemite are held together by a magnetic force so strong that it can cause headaches to those nearby. A Magnemite is also capable of "generating" two extra Magnemite in order to evolve if there are no others in the vicinity.</p><p>There are many ways that the three Magnemite which make up a Magneton can be connected, though most arrange themselves with one Magnemite on top and two below, creating a triangular formation. In some cases the Magnemite are not actually attached one another, but are still kept together by their magnetism.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/61/Zero_Magnezone.png/263px-Zero_Magnezone.png decoding=async width=175 height=98 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>When a Magneton is exposed a powerful magnetic field such as those at <a href=# title="Mount Coronet">Mount Coronet</a> or <a href=# title="Chargestone Cave">Chargestone Cave</a>, it will evolve a second time into a <a href=# title="Magnezone (Pokémon)">Magnezone</a>. One of the three Magnemite becomes more dominant and grows dramatically in shape and size, becoming more saucer-shaped and sporting a large red eye and yellow antenna on top of it. The other two Magnemite are linked permanently to either side of the main Magnemite. Magnezone has three magnet limbs, seemingly one from each of the original Magnemite. Two are used as limbs while the third trails behind, acting as a "tail" of sorts. While Magnezone is slower than Magnemite and Magneton due to its additional weight, its attack power is much greater.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Doduo_and_Dodrio>Doduo and Dodrio</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/12/Doduo_anime.png/450px-Doduo_anime.png decoding=async width=300 height=324 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> With its two heads, Doduo is perhaps one of the most bizarre of all Pokémon species<p><a href=# title="Doduo (Pokémon)">Doduo</a>'s most striking feature is its two heads, and thus two brains. These two brains are said to be identical, though in rare cases they may differ from each other. As the two heads are connected the same body, they can communicate telepathically, sensing each other's feeling and emotions. They are also skilled in cooperation; Doduo can often be seen alternatively raising and lowering its two heads to maintain balance whilst running. Doduo has also developed a habit of keeping one of its heads awake while the other sleeps, allowing it to keep a watchful eye on its surroundings and potential dangers at all times.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/33/Riding_Dodrio.png/263px-Riding_Dodrio.png decoding=async width=175 height=131 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Dodrio's size and speed make it a popular form of transport<p>Things become even more complex upon evolution to <a href=# title="Dodrio (Pokémon)">Dodrio</a>, however, with the addition of a third head. Each of Dodrio's heads has a very different personality; it is said to have one for joy, one for sorrow and a third for anger. This clash of personalities can often lead to disagreement and disputes among the three heads. However, if one of the heads is eating, the other two will also be satisfied; this is further evidence of a connection between them. When there are not quarreling, Dodrio's heads will work together to devise complex battle strategies.</p><p>The heads are not the only thing Dodrio has three of, however. It also has three sets of hearts and lungs, allowing it to run for great distances without stopping to rest. It also has three kidneys.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Exeggcute_and_Exeggutor>Exeggcute and Exeggutor</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/8e/Melvin_Exeggcute.png/450px-Melvin_Exeggcute.png decoding=async width=300 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> A single Exeggcute, consisting of six separate entities<p>While an <a href=# title="Exeggcute (Pokémon)">Exeggcute</a> may appear to be six individuals of the same species, it is in fact a single Pokémon creature. Despite this however, each "egg" which makes up an Exeggcute seems to have its own sense of identity. Being part Psychic-type Pokémon, they share a close telepathic bond, communicating in wavelengths only they can interpret. Although an Exeggcute is technically a small colony in itself, multiple Exeggcute, each consisting of six eggs, will sometimes form much larger colonies, with each Exeggcute building its own private nest to house its six members.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/65/Melvin_Exeggutor.png/263px-Melvin_Exeggutor.png decoding=async width=175 height=131 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Exeggute and Exeggutor are part of a very unusual life cycle<p>Each Exeggcute has a special energy bond which holds its six units together, and causes them to attract and spin around each other. If one of the eggs is ever separated from the group, this energy will quickly rejoin it with the others.</p><p>Exeggcute evolves into <a href=# title="Exeggutor (Pokémon)">Exeggutor</a> using a <a href=# title="Leaf Stone">Leaf Stone</a>. Exeggutor also has multiple heads, though normally only has three compared to the six it had as an Exeggcute. If it lives in a good environment, however, it will grow more heads. Each head thinks independently, but unlike Dodrio, they are friendly and never disagree with each other.</p><p>If one of Exeggutor's heads falls off, it will emit a telepathic call, searching for five other individuals with which to form a new Exeggcute, thus completing the life cycle.</p><p>In <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a>, Exeggutor has a <a href=# title="Regional form">regional form</a> with an additional, smaller head on the end of its tail.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Weezing>Weezing</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/65/James_Weezing.png/450px-James_Weezing.png decoding=async width=300 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# title="Weezing (Pokémon)">Weezing</a> is the result of two <a href=# title="Koffing (Pokémon)">Koffing</a> slowly fusing together, over a period of many years. This is unique in the Pokémon world, as most Pokémon evolve in a matter of seconds. This is not the only way a Weezing can be created, however. Similarly to Magnemite, a Koffing can also "generate" the other Koffing to become a Weezing, a method that is much faster to accomplish.</p><p>The mixture of poisonous gases from both of the Koffing makes this Pokémon much more dangerous after evolution. The twins are inversely affected by each other's actions; if one inflates, the other will deflate. It uses this technique to mix toxic gases inside its body.</p><p>Although Weezing are usually comprised of twin Koffing, on very rare occasions triplets have also been found.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Wynaut_and_Wobbuffet>Wynaut and Wobbuffet</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Girafarig>Girafarig</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f0/Lyra_Girafarig.png/450px-Lyra_Girafarig.png decoding=async width=300 height=169 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# title="Girafarig (Pokémon)">Girafarig</a> is a giraffe-like Pokémon, with the back end of its body under the control of a brain on its tail.

This causes it to have double the brainpower of a Beldum. Beldum's "feet" become "arms," allowing Metang to perform more moves than just <a href=# title="Take Down (move)">Take Down</a>.</p><p><a href=# title="Metagross (Pokémon)">Metagross</a> is created in the same way, with two Metang becoming magnetically fused. As with, Metang, the two heads combine, doubling brainpower (Metagross's base IQ is quadruple of Beldum). However, Metagross's internal computer systems and original organism can help generate more brainpower. Metang's "arms" become "legs" for Metagross, but as Metagross can levitate and use powerful Psychic attacks, so they also form as "arms" and "stands."</p><p>May it be noted that Metagross, aside from being the product of a fusion of 2-Metang/4-Beldum, is a multiple entity Pokémon in its own right. The Metagross that we see is mainly a metallic exoskeleton that functions in symbiosis with a smarter, smaller organism that functions as its <a href=# title="Psychic (type)">Psychic</a> "command center."

As it cannot use all of the energy at once, it has created another "cherry," which has developed traits of life and personality such as those of the original Cherubi. However, its main purpose is a backup powersource. The main Cherubi can drain from it at any time, causing it to be smaller and more lethargic, hence its continually "sleepy" face.</p><p>Cherubi's evolved form, <a href=# title="Cherrim (Pokémon)">Cherrim</a>, is comprised of only a single entity.
