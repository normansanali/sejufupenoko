celebrities, princes and potentates — from Ernest Hemingway and generations of Kennedys, Trump and the Clintons, to Taylor Swift, Bella Hadid and Leonardo DiCaprio.&nbsp;</p><p>First in Venice at Harry’s Bar — where the dynasty’s founder Giuseppe created the bellini from peaches and prosecco — then at Cipriani restaurants in Manhattan and London, they have made their venues the A-listers’ favorite destination to party.</p><p>Now they are trying to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raise more than $500 million</a> to turn their chain into a globe-spanning empire, which would make the firm a behemoth with condos in West Palm and Miami, a resort in Uruguay, clubs in Madrid and Tokyo and restaurants in Dubai.</p><p>But its star power and ambitious plans belie a family business tarred by secrets and scandals, including tax evasion, mob ties, an ugly war with the Rainbow Room’s owners, Harvey Weinstein’s predation and a years-battle over who even owns the Cipriani name.</p><figure

When anyone with star power came to the door, everybody fell on their knees,” Dale DeGroff, a New York-based mixologist and author of “The Craft of the Cocktail,” told The Post.&nbsp;</p><p>“They were determined to make it a place to be seen. They didn’t treat everybody the same. They treated the stars like gold and the rest of the people were expendable,” DeGroff said.&nbsp;</p><p>The family’s high society ties began in 1931, when Giuseppe Cipriani snr. opened Harry’s Bar in Venice, welcoming Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote and Katherine Hepburn and becoming a dolce vita destination in the floating city for artists, writers and aristocrats.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Cipriani family’s high society ties began in 1931, when Giuseppe Cipriani snr. opened Harry’s Bar in Venice.

They had Italian charm,” a former restaurateur told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“They had this European fine dining sophistication at a time when Italian restaurants in town were more red sauce.

He was able to make a powerhouse restaurant empire,” Jason Kaplan, a New York City-based restaurant consultant, told The Post of customers who were mesmerized by the charismatic owner.</p><p>“The food was never anything spectacular, but you weren’t going there because of the food, you were going there to see and be seen.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Giuseppe Cipriani Jr. with this dad, Arrigo.

It was a shadow of what it had been. It was a mess.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Cipriani’s took over the Rainbow Room, one of Manhattan’s most storied names, in 1999 though they were forced out years later. <span class=credit>Corbis via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In 2006, Giuseppe Cipriani’s name surfaced in two Manhattan mob trials — those of Peter Gotti and John Gotti Jr., pictured here. <span class=credit>William Farrington</span></figure><p>In 2006, Giuseppe Cipriani’s name surfaced in <a href=#>two Manhattan mob trials </a>– Peter Gotti and John Gotti Jr., son of the infamous Dapper Don.</p><p>Both times a mob turncoat testified he took a $120,000 payment from Giuseppe to buy mob assistance in settling union protests at the Rainbow Room after the family took it over, The Post reported at the time. Giuseppe Jr. later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said the testimony</a> was “all lies.”</p><p>Around the same time, Dennis Pappas – Giuseppe’s deputy – admitted that he stole more than $1 million in a health insurance scam while working as vice president of Cipriani USA.</p><p>Pappas, it turned out <a href=#>was a convicted felon </a>who had just been released early from prison when he started working for Cipriani USA in 2000.
