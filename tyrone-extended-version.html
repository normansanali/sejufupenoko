The lyrics speak to the frustration of constantly giving to someone who is not reciprocating the same level of effort in the relationship. Badu opens the song with a warning that she is testing out new material and that she is sensitive about it, which could be interpreted as her addressing criticism she may have received in the past. She then asks how the listeners are feeling before launching into her message.</p><br><p>Badu tells her partner that she is tired of their behavior, specifically that they don't buy her anything while bringing along their friends every time they meet. She expresses a desire to have quality time with her partner without any interruptions, but they don't know how to act. She then takes a jab at her partner's stinginess, with the partner refusing to give her money but expecting sex in return. Badu tells her partner that she is tired of always having to pay for them and their friends when they go out, and that they need to take responsibility for themselves. She concludes by advising her partner to call Tyrone, presumably a friend or family member who can help get the partner's life together.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I'ma test this out right quick on y'all</u><br>I'm going to try something new on you all.</p><br><p><u>Now keep in mind I'm an artist and I'm sensitive about my shit</u><br>I'm warning you that I'm emotional about my work as an artist.</p><br><p><u>So y'all be nice about it, alright</u><br>Please treat my work with respect.</p><br><p><u>Sisters how y'all feel, brothers y'all alright</u><br>I want to check in on how everyone is doing.</p><br><p><u>Let me see how y'all groove to this</u><br>I want to see how you react to my music.</p><br><p><u>Alright, I'm gettin' tired of your shit</u><br>I am fed up with your behavior.</p><br><p><u>You don't never buy me nothin'</u><br>You never buy me anything.</p><br><p><u>See every time you come around You got to bring Jim, James, Paul, and Tyrone</u><br>Every time you visit, you bring your friends along, including Tyrone.</p><br><p><u>See why can't we be by ourselves, sometimes See I've been having this on my mind for a long time I just want it to be, you and me, like It used to be, Baby But ya don't know how to act</u><br>Why can't we spend time alone? I've been thinking about this for a while now. I want to go back to just being us, but you don't behave accordingly.</p><br><p><u>So matter of fact, I think ya better call Tyrone (call him) And Tell him come on, help you get your shit (come on, come on, come on) You need to call Tyrone (call him) And tell him I said come on</u><br>In fact, I suggest you ask Tyrone for help with your issues. Call him and get him to assist you. I'm telling you to call him.</p><br><p><u>Now everytime I ask you for a little cash You say no and turn right around and ask me for some ass Oh, Well hold up, listen partna, I ain't no cheap thrill Cause Miss Badu is always comin' for real you know the deal, nigga</u><br>Whenever I ask for money, you refuse but then ask for sexual favors. Well, wait a minute, partner, I'm not that easy. I have integrity, and I'm not cheap.</p><br><p><u>Every time we go somewhere, I gotta reach down in my purse To pay your way and your homeboys way and sometimes your cousin's way They don't never have to pay, don't have no cars Hang around in bars try to hang around with stars Like Badu, I'ma tell you the truth Showing groove or get the boot</u><br>Every time we go out, I end up paying for you, your friends, and sometimes your cousin. They don't pay, don't even have cars, and just hang around trying to meet celebrities. Like me, I'm going to tell you the truth: step up or get out of my life.</p><br><p><u>I think ya better (call him) And tell him come on, help you get your shit</u><br>I still think you should ask Tyrone for help with your issues.</p><br><p><u>You need to call Tyrone (call him) Hold on but ya can't use my phone</u><br>I'm telling you again to call Tyrone, but you can't use my phone to do it.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: ERICA WRIGHT, NORMAN HURT</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH2irriitL57mJ2tX4nGs7vNnpZml3Wtwaa6w56bmI6Vp8Cqu80%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./unspeakable-new-girlfriend-everything-to-know.html>&#171;&nbsp;Unspeakable New Girlfriend Age Net Worth Real Name YouTube &amp;amp; Instagram</a>
