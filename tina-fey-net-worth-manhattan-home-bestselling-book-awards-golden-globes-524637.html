Built in 1917, Fey now owns two of the 32 units in the co-op building.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/80e7608e-1af4-4675-80a2-20ed909d2e3a.jpeg><p>In January 2016, the New York Observer reported that Fey had purchased a $9.5 million apartment.

Instyle reported that it also has a master suite with a dressing room and three additional bedrooms, each of which includes its own marble-tiled bathroom.
