This is done by first creating a roux or bechamel, which is a flour-thickened milk-based sauce. It starts off by melting butter and adding flour, garlic, and half-n-half. You can substitute half whole milk and half heavy cream for the half-n-half.</li><li><strong>Slow add in the cheese!</strong> You want to freshly grate the cheese to make sure it properly melts. I like to add 1/2 cup at a time, and allow it to completely melt before adding in more cheese. You can use a mix of cheeses.</li><li><strong>Let the sauce thicken and season it with spices, salt, and pepper</strong>. There are several choices for seasoning the mac n cheese. Some like to add hot sauce or Frank’s red sauce. You can add paprika, ground mustard, or onion powder. Fold in the pasta.</li><li><strong>Pour into a large baking dish and top with extra grated cheese and parsley</strong>. Place under a broil for several minutes to allow the cheese to become bubbly. If you want a baked macaroni and cheese, I suggest baking it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Homemade-Macaroni-and-Cheese-13-720x622.jpg alt="The Best Macaroni and Cheese is so cheesy with three types of cheese!

You want to look for cheeses that have a melting factor and also good flavor. Moist cheeses (think mozzarella) tend to melt a lot better than older, drier cheeses (think Parmesan).&nbsp;</p><p>American Cheese is known for its melting ability and that is because it is emulsifiers added to it to allow it to heat without breaking and becoming curdled.&nbsp;</p><p>I like to do a mix of different cheeses. I prefer a little sharp cheddar cheese because of its flavor profile but it doesn’t melt very well so I only use a small amount. I like to add in medium cheddar cheese because it melts better than sharp cheddar cheese and still has flavor. I like to add in either cream cheese or American cheese to add some creaminess to the mac n cheese. I also prefer to add some mozzarella cheese because it is so creamy and melts so well.</p><p>Always freshly grate your cheese! Skip the bagged cheese for this mac n cheese recipe.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Homemade-Macaroni-and-Cheese-8-720x902.jpg alt="The Best Macaroni and Cheese is so cheesy with three types of cheese!
