After a thoroughly messy season 5, fans of the series were looking forward to a tamer and more typical season 6, but thatâ€™s not what weâ€™re getting. While the behind-the-scenes elements of the show seem to have seen a major improvement, thereâ€™s still much to be desired when it comes to the cast.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">always a few villains in Love is Blind</a>, but it seems that this time around, nearly every man in the lineup was going for bad guy status. Clayâ€™s red flags could line the Pan-American Highway, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jerameyâ€™s already lying</a> to Laura, and Kenneth seemingly has no interest in actually spending time with his short-lived fiancÃ©e, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all of those misdeeds</a> pale in comparison to new rumors cropping up about Trevor.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Yeah, you read that right. Teddy bear Trevor, the sweet, mulleted muscle man who matched with Chelsea and barely missed out on popping the question. The guy we all thought was better for her than Jimmy, and with whom we desperately hoped sheâ€™d eventually reconnect. Damaging rumors about an alleged relationship are souring peopleâ€™s once-stellar opinions of the reality star, but you never know what to believe online.</p><h2 id=h-was-trevor-really-in-a-relationship-during-love-is-blind-filming data-injectable=false>Was Trevor really in a relationship during Love is Blind filming?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>All the men this season are trash.

He emerged as one of viewersâ€™ favorite participants, and a number of Love is Blind fans were devastated when Chelsea chose to accept Jimmyâ€™s proposal instead of waiting for Trevor.</p><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Trevor left the show after Chelsea broke up with him, but it seems he may not have been going home to an empty house. In the wake of the showâ€™s second drop of episodes, text messages allegedly shared between Trevor and his ex-girlfriend arose, and painted a very different picture than what Trevor initially laid down. It seems, based on the text messages, that Trevor was already in a relationship before he entered the experiment. The text messages indicate that his girlfriend at the time was in full support of his participation on the show, and may have even worked with Trevor to plan out the best storyline to get him airtime.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Theyâ€™ve since broken up â€” reportedly just two weeks ahead of the seasonâ€™s big debut â€” but quite a few people are convinced that Trevorâ€™s heart was already taken while he was on the show. He may have had a lady patiently waiting at home while he was bonding with Chelsea, and thatâ€™s seen his popularity take a major hit.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Are the viral texts real?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true><a title=@storytimewithrikkii href=#>@storytimewithrikkii</a><p>Another day, another Love Is Blind Cheating scandal. ðŸ‘€ðŸ«– Apparently Trevor was in a serious relationship when he went to film Love Is Blind Season 6 and had no intention on ever marrying anyone. In fact, he told his girlfriend in these text messages that he planned on marrying her when he got back.ðŸ‘€ WOW!! What do you guys think of these messages? <a title=loveisblindtea href=#>#loveisblindtea</a> <a title=loveisblindtok href=#>#loveisblindtok</a> <a title=loveisblindnetflix href=#>#loveisblindnetflix</a> <a title=loveisblindtrevor href=#>#loveisblindtrevor</a> <a title=loveisblindcheatingscandal href=#>#loveisblindcheatingscandal</a> <a title=loveisblindseason6 href=#>#loveisblindseason6</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - storytimewithrikkii" href=#>â™¬ original sound â€“ storytimewithrikkii</a></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Its necessary to note that you never know whatâ€™s real on the internet, and its entirely possible that the circulating texts are faked, but there are a few details that make them more believable. The dates align with the showâ€™s filming schedule, for one, with initial texts about Trevor heading to the pods falling on March 26, the day filming began. Other dates also make sense, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">based on Trevorâ€™s tenure in the pods</a>, with his following text going out on April 5, which is likely the day he and Chelsea broke up.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Other minor details align with what Trevor has revealed in the wake of the show as well, like that his dog â€” also named Chelsea â€” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away the same day he left the show</a>. That, paired with timestamped pictures of he and a woman who appear to be together just weeks ahead of the show, has many people convinced that Trevor was in a relationship the whole time he was chatting up Chelsea.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Trevor has yet to address the rumors spreading online, but the viral texts are sparking conversations all over social media. Redditors and TikTokers are invested in discovering whether or not he simply got on the show seeking fame, and theyâ€™re determined to get answers.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Enough details about Trevor have been revealed, both through the show and Trevorâ€™s own updates, that its entirely possible someone fabricated these texts just to stir up drama. After all, its an easy task to change someoneâ€™s name in your phone, and manipulating dates on screenshots is easily done these days. Those photos are harder to falsify, however, and all by themselves they seem to indicate that, even if Trevor wasnâ€™t in a relationship while he was in the pods, he was in one just ahead of his arrival on the show.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Trevor will likely have no choice but to address the rumors eventually, even if itâ€™s just to acknowledge what people are saying. If he takes the time to confirm or deny the story, weâ€™ll update this article with more details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEor%2BMramerp%2Bneqq6jJpkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXay1qrjEZp%2BeZaeWwG67zWajqK6VYra0ecGloKecXaiyor%2FOp2RvZaSdsm7CyKuYpWWiqrqwvtJmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-renata-gangemi-new-jersey-professor-shares-poster-of-israel-slaughtering-babies-690891-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Renata Gangemi?
