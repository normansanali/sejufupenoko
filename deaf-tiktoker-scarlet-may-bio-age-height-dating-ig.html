Creator Scarlet May, who is deaf and frequently uploads TikToks using both spoken English and sign language, was included in one of those clips. She frequently has long nails when communicating with her fans.</p><p>She posted a video, which PewDiePie noticed and cut short. “I’m not listening to this,” the YouTuber said in his video. “Look, she has your crazy nails, Maya!” Then he appeared to replicate American Sign Language by waving both of the dog’s paws around. “Sorry, are my nails distracting you guys,” PewDiePie continued.</p><p>The video received criticism from viewers, one of whom tweeted, “Pewdiepie isn’t ableist, he just wanted to mock a Black woman for millions of viewers for having long fingernails and speaking in her natural dialect! It’s ONLY racism”.</p><p>After learning that Scarlet is actually a deaf TikTok creator, he issued an apology.</p><p>“Hey, just to clear a few things up: I edited out the clip with the girl that has the long nails,” he commented on his YouTube video on July 27. “Had no clue <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was </a>deaf but kinda dumb of me to not realize. Still watching through the clip I only poked fun at her long nails. The voice I did for my dog is the same voice I’ve given her for years.”</p><p>PewDiePie also said that making his dog’s paws move “is an ongoing theme in the video,” adding, “Anyway <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">honest mistake</a>, my bad”.</p><p>May also addressed it in her recent video on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p><strong>Did You Know:</strong> Scarlet May lost her hearing ability at the age of 3.
