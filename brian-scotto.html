But it came at a perfect time, because that was the same year – or right after the year – that Gymkhana was in X-Games.”</strong></p><p>Brian later added:</p><p><strong>”So there was all this emphasis around Gymkhana grid and the course, so the idea of doing the ultimate Gymkhana grid course came out.”</strong></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>Brian Scotto married Ashley in September 2017.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Pascal Duvier’s wife</a>?</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>Brian Scotto is 6 ft 8 in (203 cm) tall.</p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p><br>”I wish we kept up more these past few years.

Now, as I approach 40, I realize they were actually living their best life.”</p><p>”So after years of protest, I guess I’m finally going to give Twitter a chance.
