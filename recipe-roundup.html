Made with a base of extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, or Greek yogurt, it‚Äôll be more nutritious than any bottled dressing you can find at the store. But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äì it‚Äôll taste better, too. Unlike most store-bought dressings, a homemade healthy salad dressing isn‚Äôt designed to keep for months on end. That means that it can be made with fresh ingredients like herbs, garlic, and avocado.
