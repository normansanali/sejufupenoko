From 2013 until 2023, he served as the People’s Republic of China’s premier. Notably, from 2012 to 2022, he held the position of second-ranked member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo Standing Committee (CCP), where he significantly influenced the development of the country’s economic policies and governance.</strong></p><p>As a member of the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping’s “fifth generation of Chinese leadership,” he collaborated closely with him. The daughter of Li Keqiang has recently drawn attention from the public, and people appear curious to learn more about her.</p><h2>Daughter of China Premier Li Keqiang</h2><p>Chinese economist and former politician Li Keqiang is well-known for both his fatherly and political roles. He led the People’s Republic of China as premier from 2013 to 2023. Although there is much documentation of his time in the political spotlight, not much is known about his daughter.</p><p>Some sources claim that Li Keqiang’s daughter attended Peking University, one of the most prominent universities in China, to complete her undergraduate education. She later traveled overseas to study in the US, broadening her horizons even more. Beyond these fundamentals, though, her life’s story is conspicuously lacking in details. The lack of details regarding Li Keqiang’s daughter begs the question of whether her father purposefully kept her out of the public spotlight and the media.</p><p>Public personalities frequently put their kids’ privacy first, particularly in the political arena where there is sometimes intense media scrutiny. This prudence appears to apply to Li Keqiang’s family as well, underscoring the need to keep a low profile. Li Keqiang and his spouse, Cheng Hong, are parents to a girl. Although it is known that the couple’s daughter has finished her education, she has stayed quiet and out of the spotlight.</p><p>She returned to China following her study abroad experience, but she hasn’t been seen there with her parents in the media or at public gatherings. This decision to live out of the spotlight points to a family with ties to China’s top political circles wanting some quiet and normalcy.</p><h2>Li Keqiang’s Family and Wife</h2><p>The former Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, was more than just a politician. He was a member of a close-knit family and a loving husband. Li wed Cheng Hong, a renowned academic at Beijing’s Capital University of Economics and Business. Her area of expertise was American Naturalism in English Language and Literature. Her academic endeavors demonstrated her love of language and literature.</p><p>The political history of China extended far into Li Keqiang’s family. The distinguished post of deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee was previously occupied by Cheng Hong’s father. The province of Anhui, specifically the city of Hefei, is where Li Keqiang’s ancestors originated.</p><p>Li Fengsan, his father, was an Anhui local official who supported local development and government. Unfortunately, there isn’t much information on his mother Cao Lijun that would suggest she prefers to keep her privacy a secret.</p><p>Li Keqiang came from a household of four siblings as well. Li Keming, Li Kezhen, and Li Xiaoqing, his three siblings, all experienced growing up in Anhui and seeing Li become well-known in Chinese politics. Unfortunately, Li Keqiang died of a heart attack at the age of 68. He left behind a legacy that included his political career as well as his roles as a husband, sibling, and son.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Politician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ciarán Hinds Wife | Is He Married To Hélène Patarot | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>He is a well-known actor whose fame has grown with different cinema and stage roles since starting his career in 1975.
