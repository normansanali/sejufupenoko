After all, there have been loads of pop stars who took the music world by storm only to fade away over time and then become a nostalgia act who play to smaller but passionate crowds. However, as it turns out, anyone who believed that Moore’s career would take a typical path had another thing coming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Mandy Moore has kept her fans guessing in a number of ways. For example, even though Moore’s debut album featured the kind of overproduced pop songs that were popular at the time, <a href=#>Mandy has since become a folk singer</a>. On top of that, Mandy’s career would eventually focus on acting over music and <a href=#>Moore would make enough money in Hollywood to be able to afford a beautiful and expensive home</a>. Sadly, during an interview, Moore would reveal that her acting career should have been more successful but she missed out on several roles for this shocking reason.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Pics Of Mandy Moore Producers Of 'This Is Us' Don’t Want Us To See</a></span></p><h2 id=mandy-rsquo-s-second-career>Mandy’s Second Career</h2><p>In order for anyone to make it big as a musician, they need to have so many things go right for them that it barely seems like anyone should be fortunate enough to become a famous singer. Even though Mandy Moore beat all the odds to become a pop star, it seems that wasn’t enough for her. After all, <a href=#>Moore landed many memorable acting roles</a> over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the films that she has starred in, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandy Moore headlined a long list of movies</a>. For example, when Disney adapted the story of Rapunzel into an extremely well-made animated film, Moore was the one they chose to voice the main character. On top of that, Moore starred in movies like Saved!, A Walk to Remember, Chasing Liberty, How to Deal, and 47 Meters Down among many other films.</p><p>In addition to all the movies that Mady Moore played a major role in, she has also become a notable TV star in recent years. For example, Moore starred in 60 episodes of a Disney Channel show that was originally titled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure before it became known as Tangled: The Series. More notably, Moore played a major character in one of 2016’s most talked-about shows, This Is Us.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'This Is Us' Star Was Most Famous Before The Show Premiered?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-shocking-revelation>A Shocking Revelation</h2><p>In 2007, Mandy Moore spoke to a USA Today reporter in order to promote her upcoming album at that time, “Wild Hope”, and a pair of movies she starred in, License to Wed and Dedication. Of course, whenever stars go out on a promotional tour, they should expect to be asked some questions that have nothing to do with the project they are there to bring the world’s attention to. However, if you read the 2007 USA Today article, it is still pretty wild to see how it portrays Moore.</p><p>Even though anyone with eyes should be able to see how gorgeous Mandy Moore is, the aforementioned USA Today article described her as “wholesomely pretty”. On top of that, the article described Moore’s debut single “Candy” as feather-light” and contained a weird sentence comparing Mandy to some of her peers. “While Moore insists that she's "not a goody-goody or a prude," she isn't likely to be found indulging in the kind of antics that have earned Britney, Paris or Lindsay bad press.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the overall tone of the aforementioned article, it seems very clear that its writer perceived Mandy Moore as being some kind of innocent. In reality, that feels dismissive since it is pretty clear that what is really going on is that Moore has strong feelings about the way that she wants to conduct herself in public and she stays true to them. In fact, while talking to the writer of that article, Moore revealed that because of a decision she made for herself, Mandy missed out on a lot of roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Actors Who Missed Out On Epic Film Roles</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, early in her career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandy Moore decided that she wasn’t going to film any nude scenes</a>. While talking to the writer of the aforementioned USA Today article, Moore explained her reasons for that decision and what it has meant for her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It would be completely uncomfortable to walk down the street and know that the person passing by had seen me without my clothes on. I've turned down several roles where the producers or directors or writers wouldn't budge on that point." Furthermore, Moore revealed that she was also unwilling to pose for men’s magazines that feature photos of scantily clad female stars. "I'm not saying that it's wrong for someone else to do them, but I think there's a way to be feminine and sexy without posing half-naked."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Photos That Show Mandy Moore's Transformation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqaUrnquu86rnGasn5muunnWoZitZZiWvbGxzZ6bZqyfYrWmvoycmKudlad6cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./matteo-rivolta.html>&#171;&nbsp;Matteo Rivolta</a>
